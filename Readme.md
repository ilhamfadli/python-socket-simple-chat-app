### Setup
Before running the project in this repository, you have to clone it first.

    git clone https://github.com/ilhamfadli/python-socket-simple-chat-app

Make sure the **socket**, **threading**, and **datetime** libraries are installed on your computer.

You can manually run the project by running the python files one by one in the source folder starting by running the **[server.py](https://github.com/ilhamfadli/python-socket-simple-chat-app/blob/main/source/server.py)** file. Or if you are a Windows operating system user, you can run the **[run.bat](https://github.com/ilhamfadli/python-socket-simple-chat-app/blob/main/run.bat)** script by executing **./run** in the terminal. You can change the number of clients connected to the server by changing the code in the **[server.py](https://github.com/ilhamfadli/python-socket-simple-chat-app/blob/main/source/server.py)** file on line 5.

This program allows several clients to connect to one server so that they can share information with each other. The principle used is the same as the concept of a chat group.

Here is an example when the program is run.
